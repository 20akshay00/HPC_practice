    "2) Take an incremental approach by adding pragmas one at a time\n",

    "3) Unified Memory provides a good start point where you need not worry about the data transfers (`â€“ta=tesla:managed`)\n",

    "4) Cross check the output after incremental changes to check algorithmic scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Move on to using data clauses for better performance \n",

    "**General tip:** Be aware of *Data Race* situation in which at least two threads access a shared variable at the same time. At least on thread tries to modify the variable. If data race happened, an incorrect result will be returned. So, make sure to validate your output against the serial version."
