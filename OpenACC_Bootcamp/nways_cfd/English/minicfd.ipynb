    "## CFD Simulation\n",
    "In this lab we will accelerate a Simple 2D regular-grid CFD simulation for teaching GPU programming using multiple approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "Learn how to write a portable parallel program that can run on multicore CPUs and accelerators like GPUs using OpenACC, OpenMP and std::par. Also learn how to optimize using lower level constructs using languages like CUDA-C. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Duration\n",
    "The lab material is a challenge where the particiapnts will accelerate the application using mutiple approaches to GPU programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content Level\n",
    "Beginner, Intermediate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Audience and Prerequisites\n",
    "The target audience for this tutorial is researchers/graduate students and developers who are interested in\n",
    "harnessing the power of GPUs to accelerate their scientific applications, and evaluate which programming approach best suites their needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Start Here\n",
    "You can choose between a [C-based code](C/jupyter_notebook/minicfd.ipynb).   \n",
